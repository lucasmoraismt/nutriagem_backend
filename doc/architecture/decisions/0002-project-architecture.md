# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## 1. Title
Architecture Decisions for the Python-FastAPI Backend and React Frontend

## 2. Context
This document records the architectural decisions made for the development of a simple web application with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.

## 3. Decisions

### 3.1 Backend Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic
- **ASGI Server**: Uvicorn
- **Justification**:
  - FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework that provides automatic OpenAPI documentation.
  - Pydantic ensures strong data validation and serialization.
  - Uvicorn is a lightweight and efficient ASGI server.

### 3.2 Backend Project Structure
```
/app
│── main.py  # Entry point
│── /routes  # API route definitions
│── /utils   # Utility functions and helper modules
```
- **Justification**:
  - Separation of concerns for better maintainability.
  - The `/routes` folder ensures that API endpoints are modular.
  - The `/utils` folder helps in organizing reusable functionalities.

### 3.3 API Communication
- **Request Format**: JSON body for necessary operations (POST, PUT, etc.)
- **Response Format**: JSON response
- **Justification**:
  - JSON is widely supported and ensures consistent data exchange between the frontend and backend.
  - FastAPI natively supports JSON serialization.

### 3.4 External API Integration
- **Feature**: One route integrates with a Large Language Model (LLM) API.
- **Justification**:
  - Enables AI-based features in the application.
  - Ensures flexibility for future AI service providers.

### 3.5 Frontend Technology Stack (Initial Decision)
- **Library**: React
- **Justification**:
  - React is widely adopted, with strong community support and component-based architecture.
  - Ensures scalability and flexibility for UI development.
- **Pending Decisions**:
  - Choice of additional frameworks (e.g., Next.js, Redux, etc.).
  - Deployment strategy for the frontend.

## 4. Consequences
- **Pros**:
  - The architecture is simple and modular, making it easy to extend.
  - FastAPI and Pydantic ensure fast development with strong type validation.
  - The separation of concerns improves maintainability and scalability.
- **Cons**:
  - Future frontend decisions (framework and deployment) need to be documented later.
  - AI integration requires careful monitoring of API changes and pricing.

## 5. Status
- **Backend**: Implemented
- **Frontend**: React selected; framework and deployment strategy to be decided

This document will be updated as additional architecture decisions are made.
